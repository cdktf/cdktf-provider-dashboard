# CDKTF Prebuilt provider dashboard

[![Build / Refresh Status](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-dashboard/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-dashboard/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repo publishes the [CDKTF prebuilt provider dashboard](https://cdktf.github.io/cdktf-provider-dashboard/)

The dashboard is a static site written using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and Github actions that generates every hour (ideally) and fetches the status of all CDKTF pre-built providers and builds a simple dashboard for them.
